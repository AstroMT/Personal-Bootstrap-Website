                    <p chass="text-muted text-left">From intimate cottage colonies to historic oceanfront resorts, Bermuda has plenty of gorgeous options for booking your stay. Instead of a cookie-cutter hotel room, feast your eyes on a cliffside residential enclave overlooking South Shore. Or, take your pod to a private vacation rental close enough to the water to hear the waves splashing. Traveling safely and responsibly is top-of-mind after 2020’s tumultuous days. Bermuda is the perfect destination to visit with your favorite pod — and there are plenty of safety guidelines set in place. Before you go, take a look at the island’s Covid-19 protocols and guidelines. Fill out the easy Travel Authorization Process form and follow the pre-arrival Covid-19 PCR test protocols. Start planning so you can be on island time in practically no time. </p>

Inside the woods of Fablehaven, ancient laws keep the peace between trolls, fairies, witches, satyrs and imps. Kendra, cautious and kind, explores and satisfies her curiosity within the rules.

He tries to assimilate into American culture while waiting for word about his mother. Along the way, he learns the English language, embraces school wholeheartedly, and becomes friends with an eclectic group, including a girl in foster care, an old farmwoman, and her cow. Above all, Kek’s boundless capacity for hope stands out as a beacon of inspiration for his friends and family.</p>

                            In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, the LEGO company has said that they are aiming to stop manufacturing bricks that are made of plastic resin and are considering other options, whoch could include hemp. According to <i>The Telegraph World</i>, the company makes 60 million blocks a year! While LEGO wants to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the "clicking" together as a key aspect of the iconic colored block.

                            <p class="extra">When baby Riley is born to her loving parents, so is her first emotion - Joy, who's soon joined by Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust in INSIDE OUT. The quintet live and work in Headquarters, the part of Riley's brain that experiences feelings and makes memories. With Joy as their leader, the group helps their girl through toddlerhood (ick, broccoli!) and childhood (hooray, a hockey goal!). But everything changes when 11-year-old Riley and her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco after her dad gets a new job. As Riley tries to cope with a new house, a new school, and her parents' increased stress, things get out of control back at HQ: Sadness and Joy tussle over Riley's core memories and end up getting sucked into long-term storage. Can they make it back to HQ in time to help Riley get back in touch with all of her feelings?

                            <p class="extra">Opal and her worried, distracted preacher father have just moved to tiny Naomi, Florida. At the grocery store, Opal meets a troublemaking stray dog causing chaos, claims him as hers, and names him Winn-Dixie after the store. Her dad and the landlord say "No!" But Winn-Dixie wants to stay with Opal and help her make some new friends. Soon, Opal has a job working the pet store and befriends the town librarian (Eva Marie Saint), a reclusive woman (Cecily Tyson), and some local kids. As Opal becomes more confident, she finds the courage to ask the Preacher about her mother. Because of Winn-Dixie, she has developed the maturity to begin to understand the answers. And because of Winn-Dixie, the small town of Naomi becomes once again a place where people know each other's sorrows and reach out to each other.</p>
