                <p chass="text-muted text-left">From intimate cottage colonies to historic oceanfront resorts, Bermuda has plenty of gorgeous options for booking your stay. Instead of a cookie-cutter hotel room, feast your eyes on a cliffside residential enclave overlooking South Shore. Or, take your pod to a private vacation rental close enough to the water to hear the waves splashing. Traveling safely and responsibly is top-of-mind after 2020’s tumultuous days. Bermuda is the perfect destination to visit with your favorite pod — and there are plenty of safety guidelines set in place. Before you go, take a look at the island’s Covid-19 protocols and guidelines. Fill out the easy Travel Authorization Process form and follow the pre-arrival Covid-19 PCR test protocols. Start planning so you can be on island time in practically no time. </p>

Since opening back in 1990, Universal Orlando has gone from just a single park – to multiple parks, hotels, and an entertainment complex. It’s filled with great food, family fun, and of course, amazing rides. And there’s no end in sight to Universal’s incredible growth. Every year new attractions and hotels are still being added, cementing it as one of the best travel destinations in the world!

The quintet live and work in Headquarters, the part of Riley's brain that experiences feelings and makes memories. With Joy as their leader, the group helps their girl through toddlerhood (ick, broccoli!) and childhood (hooray, a hockey goal!). But everything changes when 11-year-old Riley and her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco after her dad gets a new job. As Riley tries to cope with a new house, a new school, and her parents' increased stress, things get out of control back at HQ: Sadness and Joy tussle over Riley's core memories and end up getting sucked into long-term storage. Can they make it back to HQ in time to help Riley get back in touch with all of her feelings?

At the grocery store, Opal meets a troublemaking stray dog causing chaos, claims him as hers, and names him Winn-Dixie after the store. Her dad and the landlord say "No!" But Winn-Dixie wants to stay with Opal and help her make some new friends. Soon, Opal has a job working the pet store and befriends the town librarian (Eva Marie Saint), a reclusive woman (Cecily Tyson), and some local kids. As Opal becomes more confident, she finds the courage to ask the Preacher about her mother. Because of Winn-Dixie, she has developed the maturity to begin to understand the answers. And because of Winn-Dixie, the small town of Naomi becomes once again a place where people know each other's sorrows and reach out to each other.</p>
